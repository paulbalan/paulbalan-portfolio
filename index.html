                                    <p>The solution allows the client to empower their own clients to take charge of their events. Creating and managing events, from dates and locations to defining the meeting spaces and inviting meeting organisers as well as sending automatic reminders. Features include the ability to upload CSVs of users, viewing schedules of upcoming meetings.</p>
                                    <p>Alongside the main app, a companion web application was also developed, to be used on-site at events, showcasing the schedule and status of a particular meeting room, updated in real-time.</p>
